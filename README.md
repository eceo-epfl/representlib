# Represent Project
This document is part of the RepreSent project proposal that was accepted in January 2022 and responded to ESA ITT for AI4EO Challenges â€“ Non-Supervised Learning (AO/1-10552/21/I-DT). The project is performed under ESA Contract No. 4000137253/22/I-DT.
## Introduction

The main scope of the RepreSent project is to design, implement and validate artificial intelligence (AI) non-supervised techniques that will allow the use of the Copernicus Sentinel data. These techniques are developed for:

- Fusion of Sentinel sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2)
- Single sensor classification (multispectral or SAR Sentinel sensors)
- Change detection (e.g., Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2)
- Image time series analysis (e.g., Sentinel-2)

The software is implemented as an open source library. The validation  is done on five use cases (UC) related to:

- UC1) Forest disturbance monitoring
- UC2) Automated Land Cover mapping
- UC3) Anomaly detection in long time series of PS-P InSAR
- UC4) Cloud detection and removal
- UC5) Forest biomass estimation

The resulting datasets of the project is to be distributed freely to the AI4EO community.
