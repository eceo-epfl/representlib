libmaxdiv
=========

Welcome to `libmaxdiv`, an efficient C++ implementation of the **Maximally Divergent Intervals Algorithm**
described in the following publication:

> BjÃ¶rn Barz, Erik Rodner, Yanira Guanche Garcia, Joachim Denzler.  
> "Detecting Regions of Maximal Divergence for Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection."  
> *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* (accepted). 2018.

`libmaxdiv` supports spatio-temporal data, is easily extendable and provides a `C` interface for a
maximum of interoperability.
